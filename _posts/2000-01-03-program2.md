On <b>October 19</b> we will host the exhibition "Parlez-vous fran-sci?" in collaboration with the French Institute in Skopje, and we will organize four scientific workshops for middle-schoolers. During these workshops children will be introduced to a number of scientific concepts (electromotors, capillary action, generative AI) and they will also have a chance to explore scientific concepts in virtual reality. <br><br> Registration is open to donors of Foundation KANTAROT. The minimum donation amount is 200 MKD per workshop, and you can donate to our Macedonian bank account, or by subscribing to our Substack channel. The donation instructions can be found via our registration page. Please reach out to us (<a href="mailto:naukazadeca@gmail.com">naukazadeca@gmail.com</a>) if you cannot afford the donation amount, we will be happy to accommodate you. Spaces are limited, so hurry up!
